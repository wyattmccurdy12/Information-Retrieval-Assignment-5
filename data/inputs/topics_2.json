The volume contains four primary partitions - two for Windows (boot and data) and two for Linux (root and swap), no logical partitions. </p><p>I had problems installing any Ubuntu after 10.04 on this setup. In fact, I installed  12.04 by installing 10.04 first and then upgrading. Ubuntu 10.04 worked flawlessly, but  after upgrade to 12.04 it always displayed a message during boot in the console, something like \"iwatch dm-5 failed\" (not sure), but I didn't pay much attention to it because the system worked. Up until today's upgrade to 12.10.</p><p>Today when I upgraded to 12.10 at the end of the upgrade process it tried to install grub, and failed with the message:</p><pre><code>Path `/boot/grub' is not readable by GRUB on boot. Installation is impossible. Aborting. </code></pre><p>Then the upgrade manager offered me to select a destination for GRUB - sda, sdb or MainVolume. When I select MainVolume it falls back to the above error message and asks again. I didn't choose sda or sdb, because I thought it might write to the physical drives as non-striped and mess up existing partitions. In the end I chose not to install grub and completed the upgrade. </p><p>I'm writing this now from that box which I don't dare to reboot since it might not boot.</p><p>:(</p><p>Any ideas & sugesstions?</p>",

I found this <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/202857/cant-install-ati-proprietary-drivers-in-12-10\">wonderful question</a> and implemented @Nick Andrik's solution. In a nutshell, installing the proprietary drivers (fglrx-updates) from ppa:andrikos solved the problem. I can now use ATI Catalyst to choose my power mode and which graphics card (Intel or AMD) I want to use. My temperatures are down to ~44 degrees and battery life is up to ~4 hours again. I also installed Jupiter, which improved battery and temperatures further.</p><p>The open source drivers for AMD seem to be getting better, however it looks like their support for hybrid graphics cards (like mine) is not quite up to spec. Use the proprietary drivers for now.</p>",

However I wonder if there are any other or maybe even better alternatives (including plugins) to perform the following tasks:</p><ul><li>Print photos in the best photo-resolution the driver offers</li><li>Adjust paper size for standard values of photo papers</li><li>Choose paper tray if the printer has more than one</li><li>Print out multiple photos on one page including mixed sizes (grids)</li><li>Multiple prints with same settings</li><li>Borderless printing if the printer is capable of this</li></ul><p>Any additional options like pre-processing for color correction or noise reduction would be nice to have but are not so essential.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Specs/N/ImprovePhotoPrinting\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this spec</a> it seems not to so easy to accomplish the simple task of printing photos.</p><hr><p>Indeed all applications I have gone through have major drawbacks that make printing photos almost impossible.

        "Body": "<p>After upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 I immediately noticed an issue whereby VLC now shows terrible video when you skip around, which only appears to fix itself after a few seconds, which <em>I am guessing</em> when it next meets a keyframe. This can be shown in the screenshot below:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMywJ.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMywJ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p><p>I have tried the following to resolve the issue:</p><ul><li>Using VLC's stable ppa to get a later verison of VLC (VLC media player 2.2.4 Weatherwax)</li><li>Changing from nvidia driver 361.42 to 340.96 (which didn't work so I switched back, I made sure to reboot each time). I also tried the X.Org X server - Nouveau driver.</li><li>Trying various outputs from Automatic to X11 Video Output XCB, and OpenGL GLX video output (XCB).</li><li>Changing the Hardware-accelerated decoding from Automatic to Disable (under the Input/Codecs tab)</li><li>Disabling all but my primary monitor.</li></ul><p>I notice that if I pause the video, skip to any location, wait a second or two, and then play, the video will be fine. I just need VLC to wait until it is ready instead of trying to plow on immediately with the audio and trying to get the video to sync up.</p><p>Other media players like mpv media player just work in this regard, but I noticed mpv media player doesn't allow me to skip to the next video for some reason which is why I'm going back to trying to fix VLC.</p><h2>Update June 4th 2016</h2><p>I just installed Xubuntu on my netbook and VLC works on there perfectly well. I tried both VLC 2.2.2 and 2.2.4 from the PPA. This issue looks like its Ubuntu Desktop specific or to do with the fact that my desktop monitor runs through an Nvidia GPU (but have tested using nouveau drivers).</p><p>Another thing I noticed is that streaming media from a remote host on the same network using an NFS share makes the problem far more noticeable.</p><h2>Update 8th June 2016</h2><p>I have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8xCOCYJhR4&feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"noreferrer\">uploaded a youtube video</a> trying to demonstrate the change in behaviour where the audio never stops playing as you skip around, but the video will be \"paused\" and then kick in as pixelated before eventually sorting itself out. Normally both the audio and video would kick in together once the player is ready and there would be no video pixelation as shown here in this video of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7jzqYbBiP78\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Xubuntu 16.04 using VLC</a>.</p><h2>Update 9th June 2016</h2><p>It appears that videos I record using Kazam screen caster are <strong>not</strong> affected which led me to believe it was some proprietary codec or something. I revisited the decoding menu and found that only this option worked on a <strong>local</strong> file (I still had pixelation issues on the same video when it was loaded from an NFS folder but maybe that is yet another different issue?). </p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx6UK.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bx6UK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p><p>I am guessing that the DRM option is the important point here as VA-API via X11 did <strong>not</strong> work (and neither did \"disable\" or any of the others). <strong>I would now be keen to figure out what I need to do when I'm loading the vidoes from an NFS.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.groovypost.com/howto/change-vlc-streaming-buffer/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Increasing the stream output muxer caching</a> didn't fix it.</p><h2>Final Update - It's an Nvidia Issue (9th June 2016)</h2><p><strong>This is definitely an Nvidia graphics card related issue</strong> (haven't tested AMD). After noticing that VA-API with DRM didn't work on my work computer (which is also running Ubuntu 16.04 with an Nvidia Graphics card), when I got home I tried installing xubuntu to test that theory. That didn't do the trick. After that I unplugged my Nvidia graphics card and am now using the integrated intel graphics (on i5-4670K) which is working brilliantly on \"automatic\" and even on files loaded from the NFS. </p><p>Normally I would post this as the answer, but I don't think many others would be happy with it. I hope that maybe someone will have a solution whereby I can plug in my graphics card again, but I think the reality is we need to wait for an update to the kernel and/or better proprietary drivers from Nvidia. <strong>What amazes me is that having the card in and using the opensource nouveau drivers, or switching off hardware acceleration doesn't work.</strong> </p>",

        "Title": "Prevent nautilus showing partition mounted in bash script",
        "Body": "<p>In my bash script I mount partitions, check them, copy files to them, and unmount. When the script mounts the partition, Nautilus pops up with a Window showing the partition and stealing focus. This is something I want to avoid.</p><p>Note: I know I can change the behaviour of this in System settings, Details, Removable media, <code>Never prompt or start programs on media insertion</code>, but I don't want to change the behaviour e.g. if a USB stick is plugged in, I just want to prevent it in my bash script. Since this script runs on other users' computers I cannot modify these settings (in the script) because if it is terminated abnormally it will leave the modified settings in place (I also don't believe it should be necessary to do this).</p><p>Actually this auto display doesn't seem consistent. If I do the exact same command from the terminal, Nautilus doesn't show, and I know there are other mounts in my script that don't show. So what could be causing this? Here's an example of the code (both cause separate nautilus windows to pop):</p><pre><code>mount $dev $targetmkdir -p $target/homemount $homedev $target/home</code></pre><p>I'm interested in understanding the process by which the mount signals Nautilus and why this is happening (when it doesn't if I mount the partition from the terminal). And what is the best way to prevent this from happening.</p><p>I noticed this behaviour starting on release 11.10 (if I recall correctly). I'm currently running 12.04, but the script has to work on all supported releases. I don't believe the solution should involve modifying system settings (that might differ between releases). For example, if you look at other things that mount partitions (like os-prober), there are no nautilus windows popping up when it mounts different partitions.</p><p>The script can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/bcbc/Wubi-move\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. And <a href=\"https://github.com/bcbc/Wubi-move/blob/master/wubi-move.sh#L560\" rel=\"nofollow\">here's the part</a> where Nautilus pops. I think it also pops <a href=\"https://github.com/bcbc/Wubi-move/blob/master/wubi-move.sh#L798\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I've been focusing my testing on the first link. <a href=\"https://github.com/bcbc/Wubi-move/blob/master/check-target.sh#L213\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> is where it doesn't pop, called prior to those other mounts - note I've rewritten the first ones as --read-only and within an if statement and it makes no difference.</p><p>Ideally the answer will explain why this is happening and how to prevent it, in other words, explain why the in-script <code>mount</code> is treated differently to the one issued from a terminal. A good workaround will also be accepted if it is a fully explained solution and practical that can support all desktop environments (ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, lubuntu etc) - I also want to avoid an exponential increase in testing to verify it.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p><p>============</p><p>Solution as per <em>papashou</em>'s link:</p><pre><code>add_udev_rules (){    for i in \"$dev\" \"$homedev\" \"$bootdev\" \"$usrdev\"; do      if [ -n \"$i\" ]; then        block=${i#/dev/}        echo \"KERNEL==\\\"\"\"$block\"\"\\\",ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\\\"1\\\"\" >> \"$wubi_move_dir\"/wubi_move.rules      fi    done    cp \"$wubi_move_dir\"/wubi_move.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/wubi_move.rules    udevadm trigger > /dev/null 2>&1}remove_udev_rules (){    rm /etc/udev/rules.d/wubi_move.rules    rm \"$wubi_move_dir\"/wubi_move.rules    udevadm trigger > /dev/null 2>&1}</code></pre><p>This achieves the desired result, but feels like a sledgehammer approach. I believe there is probably a fine-tuning in udev that will allow the partition to still show in Nautilus (and other file browsers) without popping up when it's mounted. By the way if anyone wants to try this, the following script will show the pop-up effect of nautilus:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p /tmp/testmountmount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmountsleep 3umount /dev/sda1 mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmountsleep 3umount /dev/sda1 mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmountsleep 3umount /dev/sda1 mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/testmountsleep 3umount /dev/sda1 rmdir /tmp/testmount</code></pre><p>I'm going to keep playing with <code>udev</code> and I've also filed a <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/986269\" rel=\"nofollow\">bug</a>, since this doesn't make any sense for a partition that's not inserted to act like an inserted USB/media card upon mount. Also the <code>udevadm trigger</code> is not an inexpensive operation that appears (on 12.04 at least) to temporarily freeze everything.</p><p>So, in summary, I have a workable solution (thanks to everyone who helped out), which I may or may not implement (not sure yet); but I'll keep looking for something else.Thanks</p>",

Several times now, the top-level menu bar, the task bar — and seemingly every system dialog — have forgotten the out-of-the-box \"Ambiance\" theme they conform to when I first installed the system. Window captions still preserve the theme, but pretty much nothing else does.</p><p>I have searched high and low on Google for assistance with this problem. Everything I've found suggests either running some gconf reset or deleting .gconf* .gnome* and other similar directories. I have followed all this advice and nothing works. I still get a boring Windows-95-style gray 3D look and feel. On previous occasions, after much messing around I've given up and rebooted the VM instance, and been pleasantly suprised to see the original \"Ambience\" theme restored throughout the UI, but invariably it disappears again some time later, usually after a reboot, so I can never figure out what I did that broke it.</p><p>Here's a sample from Ubuntu's site of what I want it to look like.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwEPu.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p><p>And here's a screenshot of my system as it currently looks.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZwbk.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p><p>Also note that my GNOME Terminals normally have a nice purple semi-translucent look, and as can be seen from the screenshot, they are now just a solid matte white.</p><p>This last time (just yesterday), trying numerous combinations all the usual tricks and rebooting several times hasn't fixed it, so here I am on SU wondering: </p><p><strong>How do I recover the out-of-the-box theme for my Gnome/Ubuntu desktop, noting that blowing away all config files — as suggested in many places online — fails to achieve this?</strong></p><p>It might help to know that it seems to fail either after I resize the VM instance, forcing the Ubuntu desktop to resize itself, or after I play around with Compiz settings. I haven't been able to figure out which of these it is, and it could be neither. Given the amount of pain I have had to go through to get things back to normal (and given that I am at a loss as to how to do so), it has proven difficult to definitively isolate the cause.</p>",

In Ubuntu 12.04, NetworkManager no longer works with the file. You have to directly consult the command line tool <code>nm-tool</code>.</p><p>Interestingly, <code>nm-tool</code> is no longer installed by default in 14.04 and later. Although you may still install through <code>apt-get install</code>, you can't assume all Ubuntu to have that out of the box.</p><p>So the question remains. How do you know, by default installation, the DNS you're using by command line?</p>",

Install was a little clunky but everything seemed to go just fine.  Issue is whenever I log in, the desktop loads but either it totally freezes (mouse not moving, keyboard not functioning), or the mouse will still be moveable but nothing lights up when hovered over and clicks do nothing same with keyboard.  This happens every time I log in.</p><p>I rebooted and used the check disc tool and it reports everything is fine.  Tried reinstalling, same issue.  Made a second disk with Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator program, install went smoother that time but same issue on login.  </p><p>I am using a HP DV6000 laptop that worked just fine with 12.04</p><p>I am at a loss here, maybe somebody has a little insight, any help would be appreciated, much love for this community</p>",

        "Body": "<p>I have a System76 Gazelle, gapz8, running Ubuntu 14.04. My wifi keeps dropping out at random intervals. I have a new router, so I don't believe that's the issue, but I am in an apartment building, so the signals are probably crowded. My computer still registers the wifi as connected, but stops sending and receiving data. I've found that disconnecting from the wifi and reconnecting fixes the problem, but it can happen again within minutes. Does anyone understand the problem or how to fix it? I'm happy to provide more information if that will clarify the issue, just tell me what.</p><p>As requested below, the results from the \"wireless script\"\"</p><pre>########## wireless info START ##########Report from: 28 Sep 2014 23:17 EDT -0400Booted last: 28 Sep 2014 20:28 EDT -0400Script from: 20 Sep 2014 23:04 UTC +0000##### release ###########################Distributor ID: UbuntuDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTSRelease:    14.04Codename:   trusty##### kernel ############################Linux 3.13.0-36-generic #63-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 3 21:30:07 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/LinuxParameters: ro, quiet, splash, acpi_os_name=Linux, acpi_osi=, vt.handoff=7##### desktop ###########################Ubuntu##### lspci #############################02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 2230 [8086:0887] (rev c4)    Subsystem: Intel Corporation Centrino Wireless-N 2230 BGN [8086:4062]    Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi03:00.2 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

It would be nice to see some use cases: if I want to run a command and then after it shutdown my computer, which connector should I choose?</li><li>What are their <strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>dangers</strong>? <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/users/7808/robie-basak\">Robie Basak</a> mentions in a comment to <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/a/334943/115155\">this answer</a> that a command like <code>cd /somewhere_else; rm -Rf *</code> can have destructive consequences if the first element in the command chain fails, for instance.</li><li>If relevant, where do they come from? </li></ol>",

Unfortuantely it didn't quite solve the problem (see below for how).</p><p>I followed the instructions and ran the following check, to which I received an encouraging response:</p><pre><code>$ dpkg -S `which sendmail`postfix: /usr/sbin/sendmail</code></pre><p>However when I started postfix again, I got the same error.</p><p>As per Oli's contingency, I looked for the process that was hogging port 25 with the following:</p><pre><code>$ sudo netstat -pel | grep smtptcp        0      0 localhost.localdom:smtp *:*                     LISTEN      root       35704126    27626/sendmail: MTA</code></pre><p><strong>But here's where it got confusing:</strong> I then looked for the process <code>27626</code> but was then told: </p><blockquote>  <p>dpkg-query: no path found matching pattern <em>27626<br/>  connections</em>.</p></blockquote><p> I pulled up htop and was able to find the above PID associated with the following command:</p><blockquote>  <p>sendmail:MTA: accepting connections</p></blockquote><p>I then tried to kill the process with both <code>killall sendmail</code> and <code>killall 27626</code> and kept getting <code>no process found</code>.</p><p><strong>The problem is</strong> (besides the obvious) I don't know how to interpret these findings.  I scrubbed the server of sendmail, so I can only assume that postfix's own version of sendmail is hijacking the port?

As a side note, if I run <code>sudo ifconfig wlan0 up</code>, the indicator LED gets white (indicating that the card was enabled), but Ubuntu still say that the card is blocked by hardware.</p><p>Extra information: the card works without issues in windows and in Ubuntu installer (booting from a live CD). I'm using the card out-of-box, using the drivers already included in Ubuntu 12.10. The module <code>rt2800pci</code> is loaded and working fine, not blacklisted, etc, etc. The card and the button toggle worked flawlessly until today, when I toggled it off and can't turn it on anymore...</p><hr><p>The problem is back, but in a different manner: if I don't press the wifi key a few times during the grub loading, in the login screen the wifi button will be ambar (disabled), pressing it will toggle it white (enabled) or ambar  (disabled) again, but ubuntu still says that the network card was disabled by hardware and doesn't connect...</p><p>In other words, if I don't press the WiFi button a few times when Ubuntu is booting, it will be stuck with the \"network card was disabled by hardware\" message, even if the light is white (enabled).

Some of them are imgur, yahoo, <a href=\"http://fed-sudoku.eu/enindex.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fed-sudoku</a>, microsoft and addons page of firefox. I am sure there are many more that won't load.</p><p>I have Windows 7 in Dual-Boot and there are no problems whatsoever in opening these pages on Windows.</p><p><strong>Brief History</strong></p><p>Two weeks ago I installed Ubuntu 12.10. I faced this issue right away. I thought something must have gone wrong with the installation, so I removed Ubuntu 12.10 and instead installed Lubuntu 12.10, but the issue persisted. So, I tried opening these webpages in Live Environments (of Ubuntu 12.10, Lubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu 12.04.1) from USB. The issue was there for Ubuntu 12.10 and Lubuntu 12.10. However, I was able to access these webpages from Ubuntu 12.04.1. So, I installed 12.04.1 on my HardDisk. Everything on 12.04 was fine till yesterday; but suddenly, these sites don't load anymore. Windows 7 in Dual-Boot works flawlessly.</p><p><strong>Updates</strong></p><p><strong>(1)</strong> In response to Zhang's Answer to check <code>basic terminal commands</code> - I have used both OpenDNS and GooglePublic DNS to test these commands (Restarted my PC in between). These are the terminal outputs while <a href=\"http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1442002/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">using OpenDNS</a> and while <a href=\"http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1442018/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">using GooglePublicDNS</a>.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> This is the result of <code>ifconfig</code> - <a href=\"http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1442392/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pastebin Link</a>.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> Thereafter I tried to use <code>wget</code> to check if the problem was with the Browser. However, it didn't work for webpages which are not loading in my browser. This is the <a href=\"http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1443397/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pastebin Link</a> showing it for Google(works) and Yahoo(doesn't work).</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> Then followed the instructions listed at <a href=\"http://www.noobslab.com/2012/05/disable-ipv6-if-your-internet-is.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">noobslab</a> to <code>disable IPV6</code>. Also, restarted my PC. However, it didn't help either.</p><p><strong>(5)</strong> Then, I edited my Wired Connection through Network-Manager to <code>ignore IPV6</code>. After that, I tried to open Yahoo in Browser -  it did load the first time. However, when I tried again, it didn't load. Other problem sites didn't load at all.</p><p><strong>(6)</strong> Again tried <code>wget</code>. However, this time passed the argument <code>-4</code> to it; ie; <code>wget -4 www.yahoo.com</code>. But once again, didn't get any response.</p><p><strong>(7)</strong> Then, tried to fiddle with <code>MTU</code>. Followed <a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=872346\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this link</a> to check what is the maximum that I can set. For me, the maximum possible was 10324. Also tried other values like 1500, 1492, 1452 and 100. But this didn't help either.</p><p><strong>(8)</strong> <code>Re-installed Ubuntu 12.04.1</code>, wiping out the previous installation and as such all other changes. Also installed all the available updates. For the first half-an-hour, I was able to load all the webpages - including the ones which had problem. But lateron, I have the same issue as earlier - not able to load pages like yahoo, imgur, microsoft, fed-sudoku, etc. </p><p><strong>(9)</strong> <em>Question by laurent</em></p><blockquote>  <p>From wget pastebin info in the question, the problem is not DNS as the <code>wget</code> and <code>dig</code> commands reach Yahoo's IP. This said, I don't know why nothing downloads with wget! Have you set a firewall? (you can check with <code>sudo iptables -L</code>). In <code>ifconfig</code> results, there are 2 interfaces, ppp0 and eth0. Which one should be used to connect to internet? Could you post the result of <code>route</code> command? Obs: eth0 has no IPV4 address so I think it is not properly configured (how is <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>?)</p></blockquote><p>Here is the <a href=\"http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1445255/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pastebin Link</a> for terminal outputs of <code>sudo iptables -L</code> ; <code>route</code>  and  <code>cat /etc/network/interfaces</code>. I am not running any firewall. It's a clean install of Ubuntu 12.04.1. ppp0 is used to connect to the internet (this takes username and password which was given by my ISP) and eth0 is the Intel's OnBoard LAN which connects the modem through ethernet port.</p><p><strong>(10)</strong> Tried to append <code>nameserver 208.67.222.222</code> line in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> (since, I am using OpenDNS). But this didn't help (even after restart). So reverted the changes back. This is also a part of answer provided by laurent - it's required if I want to use OpenDNS.</p><p><strong>Other Info</strong></p><ul><li>I have an ADSL modem (not a router) connected to the PC with an Ethernet Port.

        "Body": "<h1>Purpose</h1><p>I want to install Ubuntu Desktop 16.04.1 LTS completely unattended. Put ISO CD in and walk away.</p><h2>Issues</h2><ul><li>Boot parameters incorrect</li><li>Questions still being asked and needing mouse clicks</li><li>Convoluted answers using kickstart/preseed</li><li>Documentation examples no working as stated, specifically from partman and ubunutu</li></ul><p>I came across this post <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/122505/how-do-i-create-a-completely-unattended-install-of-ubuntu\">here</a> and it was close to what I needed but didn't quite accomplish what I needed since it was for Ubuntu Server. The post suggests using a \"non-graphical\" Ubuntu install, but I couldn't find a non-graphical install for Ubuntu Desktop, which makes sense. I tried to adapt the steps and get it working for Ubuntu Desktop 16.04.1 LTS.</p><h3>Documentation Used</h3><p>I have used all the following resources...</p><p>Apparently I can't include all of my resources because askubuntu doesn't allow more than 2 links. Well that's not very helpful - so here is just a list:</p><ul><li>AskUbuntu </li><li>Ubuntu install.en.pdf </li><li>Preseed Examples</li><li>Ubiquity Installer Documentation</li><li>Partman Documentation and Examples</li><li>Partition Recipe Explaination of the 3 numbers and their weighting</li><li>A More Complex Preseed Example</li></ul><h2>Current Solution</h2><p>I have currently created an unattended install, but am not sure if it is correct - meaning that I should have edited the isolinux/isolinux.cfg</p><p>There were many differences between the post I linked and the Ubuntu Desktop image. Here is my solution:</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p>Mounted Ubuntu ISO so that I can copy the contents to another directory and then edit the pertinent files.</p><pre><code>mkdir -p /mnt/isomount -o loop ubuntu.iso /mnt/iso</code></pre><h3>Step 2</h3><p>I then copied the ISO files to another directory for editing.</p><pre><code>mkdir -p /opt/ubuntuisocp -rT /mnt/iso /opt/ubuntuiso</code></pre><h3>Step 3</h3><p>I edited the <code>isolinux/isolinux.cfg</code> file and replaced everything inside with the following:</p><pre><code>default live-installlabel live-install  menu label ^Install Ubuntu  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi  append  file=/cdrom/ks.preseed auto=true priority=critical debian-installer/locale=en_US keyboard-configuration/layoutcode=us ubiquity/reboot=true languagechooser/language-name=English countrychooser/shortlist=US localechooser/supported-locales=en_US.UTF-8 boot=casper automatic-ubiquity initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash noprompt noshell ---</code></pre><p>The append line is very long so for easy reading, here are all the options I used:</p><pre><code>file=/cdrom/ks.preseed auto=true priority=critical debian-installer/locale=en_US keyboard-configuration/layoutcode=us ubiquity/reboot=true languagechooser/language-name=English countrychooser/shortlist=US localechooser/supported-locales=en_US.UTF-8 boot=casper automatic-ubiquity initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash noprompt noshell</code></pre><p>I found that all these boot parameters were needed to get a completely unattended install. For Ubuntu Server, it may be different.</p><h3>Step 4</h3><p>I tried using and creating many preseed files, but I found the more complex, the more chance for errors. This is currently my simple preseed file that works with the above <code>isolinux.cfg</code> file.</p><pre><code>### Partitioningd-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sdad-i partman-auto/method string regulard-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean trued-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean trued-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmationd-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean trued-i partman/choose_partition select finishd-i partman/confirm boolean trued-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true# Localed-i debian-installer/locale string en_USd-i console-setup/ask_detect boolean falsed-i console-setup/layoutcode string us# Networkd-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostnamed-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domaind-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto# Clockd-i clock-setup/utc-auto boolean trued-i clock-setup/utc boolean trued-i time/zone string US/Pacificd-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true# Packages, Mirrors, Imaged-i base-installer/kernel/override-image string linux-serverd-i base-installer/kernel/override-image string linux-image-amd64d-i mirror/country string USd-i mirror/http/proxy stringd-i apt-setup/restricted boolean trued-i apt-setup/universe boolean trued-i pkgsel/install-language-support boolean falsetasksel tasksel/first multiselect ubuntu-desktop# Usersd-i passwd/user-fullname string Liasond-i passwd/username string liasond-i passwd/user-password-crypted password [crpyt 3]d-i passwd/root-login boolean trued-i passwd/root-password-crypted password [crypt 3]d-i user-setup/allow-password-weak boolean true# Grubd-i grub-installer/grub2_instead_of_grub_legacy boolean trued-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean trued-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note# Custom Commands</code></pre><p>I didn't include my encrypted passwords so if you try this preseed file, please change them to an encrypted password. <a href=\"https://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/generating-passwords-using-crypt3/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a> is 3 ways to make the password.</p><h3>Step 5</h3><p>I created the new ISO from the the <code>/opt/ubuntuiso/</code> directory.</p><pre><code>mkisofs -D -r -V ATTENDLESS_UBUNTU -cache-inodes -J -l -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o /opt/autoinstall.iso /opt/ubuntuiso</code></pre><h3>Step 6</h3><p>I finally tested it with Virtualbox and it created a completely unattended install.</p><h2>Questions</h2><p>Should I have to be editing the <code>isolinux/isolinux.cfg</code> file?</p><p>In the other post, it seems they are able to edit the <code>isolinux/txt.cfg</code> file and are able to make that work.

The standard \"Music\" and \"Videos\" folders are configured identically: the \"Guest Access\" box is checked, but the \"Allow others to create and delete\" is not. The third folder, called \"shared\", is configured to not allow Guest access but to allow others to modify files. I have not altered <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code> by hand, I have only used Sharing Options to create and modify these so-called \"shares\".</p><p>My roommates have two Windows 7 computers and one Ubuntu Netbook Remix netbook. I have the aforementioned desktop machine and laptop running 10.04. None of these machines can access any of the shares. Attempts to access the Guest shares result in the message</p><p><code>\\\\machine\\directory is not accessible. The network name could not be found.</code></p><p>This is the error message generated by a VM running Windows 2000. The other Windows machines generate a similar error. The Ubuntu laptop gives the error <code>Unable to mount location: Failed to mount Windows share</code>. Hurrah, once again, for informative error messages. That really helps a lot.</p><p>When attempting to browse the folder called \"shared\" from the laptop, I'm confronted with a password dialog. This behavior is the same will all machines I've tried in the situation. On entering my username and password for the account to which the shares belong, the password dialog briefly disappears and is replaced with an identical dialog. No error message, useful or not, appears.</p><p>When attempting to browse this folder with the VM, the outcome is the same except that the password dialog helpfully states \"incorrect username or password\". My assumption is that the username and password in question is that of the user which owns the shares. I have tried all other username and password combinations available in this context and the outcome is the same.</p><p>I would like to be able to share files. Sharing them with Windows machines is a nice feature, or would be if it was available. Really I consider sharing files between two machines with the same version of the same operating system kind of a minimum condition for network usability.</p><p>Samba last functioned reliably for me more than ten years ago. I have attempted to use it on and off since then with only intermittent success. </p><p>Oh, and \"Personal File Sharing\" from the Preferences menu does not result in an entry in Places → Network → my-server.

It worked fine logging on to my admin account, and also in Gnome's safe mode.

The commands I used to install these are given below:</p><pre><code>1: sudo passwd2: su3: apt-get install php54: apt-get install apache25: apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client6: apt-get install phpmyadmin7: apt-get install python8: apt-get install python-mysqldb9: ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf10: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</code></pre><p>Then everything works fine. The LAMP server runs great. Then i thought to upgrade the whole LAMP server I mean the PHP, Apahce, MySQL, phpMyAdmin etc. Then I searched in google and get some ppa which got the latest versions of these softwares. Then I added those ppa. The ppa links:</p><pre><code>1. https://launchpad.net/~tuxpoldo/+archive/phpmyadmin2. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/mysql-5.63. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/apache24. https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5</code></pre><p>Then is used these ppa and firstly upgraded the phpmyadmin then MySQL server then Apache and then PHP.After upgradation of phpmyadmin and mysql server the whole LAMP server runs well with the updated mysql server and phpmyadmin. But after the upgradation of Apache and PHP the phpmyadmin is not showing up. When I try:</p><pre><code>http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin</code></pre><p>it says \"Not Found\".</p><p>How can I sove this problem with the phpmyadmin?? Please help me as fast as you can. I am in great trouble for this.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
